## Hi there 👋

**I'm an infectious disease modeler interested in statistical modeling, forecasting, real-time analysis and open source tool development.**

Currently:
- Assistant professor in Sebastian Funk's [EpiForecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group
  - :coffee: Using daily: `R`,`stan`
  - excited about combining multiple data streams for joint inference, developing methods and building software to improve and increase access to real-time forecasting and outbreak response tools

A bit about me: 
- :office: 2025- Assistant professor at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) in Sebastian Funk's [EpiForecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group within [CMMID](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). Working on: 
  - Developing R package [`baselinenowcast`](https://github.com/epinowcast/baselinenowcast) for correcting for bias in recent data due to right-truncation in epidemiology and [evaluating its performance](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.14.25333653v2).
  - [Retrospective evaluation of wastewater-based forecasting](https://github.com/epiforecasts/evalwwforecasts) of hospital admissions at the state-level in Germany.
  - [Producing](https://github.com/epiforecasts/cityforecasts) and evaluating [local-level flu forecasts](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast) in the U.S.
  - Development and [evaluation](https://github.com/epiforecasts/evalvariantnowcasthub) of outputs from the [U.S. SARS-Cov-2 Variant Nowcast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub).
- :office: 2023- Data scientist at the [CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) developing and evaluating models to forecast hospital admissions using wastewater surveillance data. Developed R package [`wwinference`](https://github.com/cdcgov/ww-inference-model) to run wastewater-informed forecasting model and [evaluating forecast performance](https://github.com/CDCgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting) in real-time and retrospectively. 
- :office: 2021-2023 Data analyst at The Rockefeller Foundation’s [Pandemic Prevention Institute](https://github.com/PandemicPreventionInstitute), developing models and tooling for [nowcasting variant prevalence dynamics](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.02.23284123v4.full) globally + other public
- :office: 2020-2021 Postdoc in infectious disease modeling at [UT’s COVID-19 Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/) supervised by [Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/index.html)
- :books: 2016-2020 PhD at the University of Texas at Austin on integrating single-cell sequencing and cancer cell population dynamics data supervised by [Amy Brock](https://www.brocklab.com/) and [Tom Yankeelov](https://cco.oden.utexas.edu/)
- :books: 2012-2016 BS at Georgetown University studying biophysics
- 🔆 Generally passionate about wastewater-based epidemiology, partial pooling/hierarchical modeling, viral variant dynamics, cost-effectiveness analysis, integration of disparate data sources
- 🌎 Learning more about package/software development, cloud computing, CI/CD, all the things to improve open science/reproducibility
