## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm an infectious disease modeler interested in statistical modeling, forecasting, real-time analysis and open source tool development.**

Currently:
- Data Scientist at the [CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html)
- Working on:
  - ðŸš½ Developing methods and tooling for [inference and forecasting using wastewater viral concentration data and hospital admissions](https://github.com/CDCgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting) 
      - :hammer: developing R package for [wastewaster-informed forecasting](https://github.com/cdcgov/ww-inference-model)
      - :chart_with_upwards_trend: evaluating forecast performance with and without wastewater data
  - :coffee: Using daily: `R`,`stan`

A bit about me:

- :office: 2021-2023 Data analyst at The Rockefeller Foundationâ€™s [Pandemic Prevention Institute](https://github.com/PandemicPreventionInstitute), developing models and tooling for nowcasting variant prevalence dynamics globally + other public
- :office: 2020-2021 Postdoc in infectious disease modeling at [UTâ€™s COVID-19 Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/) supervised by [Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/index.html)
- :books: 2016-2020 PhD at the University of Texas at Austin on integrating single-cell sequencing and cancer cell population dynamics data supervised by [Amy Brock](https://www.brocklab.com/) and [Tom Yankeelov](https://cco.oden.utexas.edu/)
- :books: 2012-2016 BS at Georgetown University studying biophysics
- ðŸ”† Generally passionate about wastewater-based epidemiology, partial pooling/hierarchical modeling, viral variant dynamics, cost-effectiveness analysis, integration of disparate data sources
- ðŸŒŽ Learning more about package/software development, cloud computing, CI/CD, all the things to improve open science/reproducibility
